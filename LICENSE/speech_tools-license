The Edinburgh speech tools system is a library of C++ classes, functions
and utility programs that are frequently used in speech software. The
system compiles to a single unix library .a file which can be linked
with software. At present, C++ classes for several useful speech and
language classes have been written, along with audio software and some
basic signal processing software.
