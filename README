SailAlign

Long speech-text alignment can facilitate large-scale study of rich spoken 
language resources that have recently become widely accessible, e.g., collections 
of audio books, or multimedia documents. SailAlign is an open-source software toolkit 
for robust long speech-text alignment implementing an adaptive, iterative speech recognition 
and text alignment scheme that allows for the processing of very long (and possibly noisy) 
audio and is robust to transcription errors.

The software package was originally presented at VLSP-2011:
A. Katsamanis, M. Black, P. Georgiou, L. Goldstein and S. Narayanan, 
SailAlign: Robust long speech-text alignment,
in Proc. of Workshop on New Tools and Methods for Very-Large Scale Phonetics Research, Jan. 2011.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following command while inside the SailAlign distribution folder. 
The module can currently only work on linux - like operating systems. It has been tested in the following architectures:
linux_i686, linux_x86_64 
Compiled HTK binaries, including HDecode have to be available in your system, e.g., in the folder $HTK_BIN.
You may need to be connected to the internet to install dependencies :

       1) cpan Module::Build
       	  This will install the Module::Build perl package from CPAN. You may skip this step if you have 
	  the package already installed. It is used for the installation of the SailAlign package. If you haven't run the
	  command cpan before you may have to go through a setup process. You can just
	  select the default options when user input is required.  
       2) perl Build.PL
       	  This command configures the building process. Among others it will try to detect dependencies
	  that are not installed in your system. Ignore any messages for missing dependencies in the beginning. 
	  Provide the folder $HTK_BIN when asked. 
       3) ./Build installdeps
       	  Run this command if you got a message for missing dependencies in the previous step.
       3) ./Build
       	  This command will build the module.
       4) sudo ./Build install
          This command will install the module. The following perl scripts will be added to your path:
	  sail_align, sail_align_parallel


TESTING

To test that the module has been properly installed you may run the following from inside the distribution folder:
>> sail_align -i support/data/timit_5.wav -t support/data/timit_5.txt -w support/data/test/timit_sample_test 
   	      -e timit_sample_test -c config/timit_alignment.cfg

This will run the alignment algorithm for the audio file timit_5.wav and the corresponding transcription timit_5.txt. The 
results will be in the working directory 'support/data/test/timit_sample_test'. You may check the tutorial in the 'docs'
folder for additional details.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

You may find additional documentation inside the docs subfolder, including the paper on SailAlign presented at 
VLSP-2011 and a relevant tutorial that was given there as well.
